        description: "Freelance: I had the opportunity to redesign the website for Thrive Construction, a company dedicated to providing alternative solutions for clients who need the expertise of a large general contractor, but desire the personal service and attention of a small one. My focus was on creating a modern, user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience and effectively communicates the company's mission and services. The redesign involved updating the visual aesthetics, improving site navigation, and ensuring mobile responsiveness to cater to a broader audience.",
